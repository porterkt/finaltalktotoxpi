Toxicological data communicating the effects of environmental risk have become increasingly dispersed across diverse databases. Drawing data from these varied sources can prove tedious and inefficient for scientists and non-scientists alike. In the field of toxicology, data retrieval is further complicated by the abundance of chemicals and recorded metrics, decreasing the accessibility of medical and environmental information to the public as well as the ability to visualize these data. To address these issues, several significant tools have been developed, including ToxPi, an interactive visualization model that integrates multiple data sources (Marvel 2018). This research intends to build upon the advances of ToxPi while integrating Artificial Intelligence into toxicological visualization research.
